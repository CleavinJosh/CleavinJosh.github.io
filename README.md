What to Include in a Hero Banner:
Headline:

This could be something like:

"Hi, I’m Cleavin Josh – Web Developer & IoT Enthusiast"

"Building Smart Solutions with Code and Creativity"

"Bridging Hardware and Software for the Future"

Short Description/Tagline:

A brief line that summarizes your mission or expertise.

"Passionate about creating seamless experiences through full-stack web development and embedded systems."

Image or Video Background:

Use a clean, high-quality image related to your work. You can also use an animated video, but keep it subtle and relevant.

A background of you working on a project or your tech tools.

A clean tech-inspired background if you’re focused on coding, web development, or IoT.

Call-to-Action (CTA):

This can be a button linking to a section or another page. Examples:

"See My Projects"

"Contact Me"

"View My Resume"

"Let's Talk!"

Social Links:

If appropriate, add social media icons like LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter, so people can follow you easily.

Your Photo (Optional):

If you’re comfortable with it, a photo of yourself can humanize the portfolio and make it more personable.

Tips for a Good Hero Banner:
Keep it simple: Avoid clutter. The message should be clear and concise. Don’t overdo it with too much text or too many images.

Responsive Design: Make sure your hero banner looks great on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Subtle Animation: You can add subtle animations or transitions (like text fading in) to make the hero section more dynamic, but avoid going overboard.

Contrast: Ensure the text stands out from the background by using high contrast colors or adding a subtle overlay to the image.
